# Portfolio
This is my personal portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to showcase my skills, education, and projects in a clean and responsive design. I implemented smooth scrolling and section-based navigation to improve user experience, and I hosted it on GitHub Pages so it's accessible to everyone.
